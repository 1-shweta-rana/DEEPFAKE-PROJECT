# DEEPFAKE-PROJECT

This repository is part of the Blackbucks project focused on computer vision.

Deepfake Detection using ELA and ResNet50:
This project identifies deepfake videos by applying Error Level Analysis (ELA) on extracted video frames and classifying them using a ResNet50-based CNN. It processes both real and fake videos, performs ELA preprocessing, and trains a binary classifier with GPU acceleration.

Note: The code is not fully optimized due to extended training times. Future improvements and refinements are planned.
